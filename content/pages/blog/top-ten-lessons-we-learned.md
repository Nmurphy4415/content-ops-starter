Have you ever had a vision of what you wanted to achieve but felt like it just kept slipping
away? 

We’re good at talking the talk, but equally as good at letting opportunity slip away.

What’s one thing you’ve been putting off for too long? How long have you been thinking about it? Why haven’t you accomplished it yet? 

I know I spent far too much time myself without clearly defined goals. It sucks. We naturally dream big. Of course we want the world for ourselves. Don’t you? Don’t you think you deserve to achieve that? I absolutely do.

When it comes to achieving our dreams, we need to turn them into reality. We need goals, not dreams.

So what’s a goal and what’s a dream? Simply put, a goal is a dream with a timeline or fixed date to accomplish it by. This forces us into action if we want to meet our
goal. 

Some of the biggest benefits of setting goals include

1.   Gaining a clear direction and focus for your efforts. This is widely underrated – you’re always doing, why not do the right things in the right direction to support your goals?

2.   You can track our success and improvement because you know exactly what you're working towards.

3.   Goals help mobilize energy which can lead to more effort overall

4.   More free time. That’s right, having clearly defined goals can reduce the amount of time we spend overthinking situations, tasks and even our own dreams. You know what you need to do when you need to do it.
